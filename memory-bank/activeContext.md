# Active Context: Saticiyiz

## Current Focus

The project is currently in its initial development phase. Our primary focus areas are:

1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**
   - Docker containerization for both frontend and backend
   - Environment configuration
   - Database schema design and implementation

2. **Trendyol Integration**
   - API credential management
   - Product synchronization
   - Order management workflows

3. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login system
   - User registration
   - Token-based authentication

## Recent Changes

- Established the basic project structure with frontend and backend separation
- Created Docker and Docker Compose configuration
- Designed initial database schema
- Set up Supabase connection
- Configured development environments

## Development Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (Current Sprint)

1. **Backend Development**
   - Complete API endpoint implementation for user management
   - Implement Trendyol API integration services
   - Set up authentication middleware

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Build login and registration components
   - Create dashboard layout and navigation
   - Implement product listing and detail views

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Finalize database migration scripts
   - Complete Docker configuration for production
   - Implement initial testing framework

### Near-Term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Feature Development**
   - Implement product synchronization
   - Build order management interface
   - Create analytics dashboard

2. **Integration**
   - Complete Trendyol API integration
   - Set up email notification system
   - Implement Google Sheets export

3. **User Experience**
   - Refine navigation and workflows
   - Implement responsive design for mobile
   - Add user preference settings

## Active Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Using JWT with refresh tokens for extended sessions
   - Implementing Supabase Auth vs. custom authentication system

2. **Data Synchronization Approach**
   - Determining optimal frequency for Trendyol data sync
   - Choosing between webhook vs. polling for real-time updates

3. **Frontend State Management**
   - Evaluating Context API vs. Redux for application state
   - Deciding on data fetching and caching strategies

4. **Deployment Architecture**
   - Finalizing production hosting environment
   - Planning scalability strategy

## Known Issues

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Trendyol API rate limits may affect synchronization performance
   - Mobile responsiveness needs improvement in data-heavy screens

2. **Open Questions**
   - Optimal strategy for handling large product catalogs
   - Best approach for multi-marketplace support in future versions

## Team Collaboration

- Backend and frontend teams working in parallel
- Daily coordination through standups
- Shared documentation in project wiki
- Feature branches with code reviews before merging to main
