## Market Need

E-commerce sellers in Turkey face several challenges when managing their online businesses:

1. **Fragmented Management**: Sellers often need to juggle between multiple marketplace dashboards, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
2. **Pricing Complexity**: Calculating optimal prices while accounting for commissions, shipping costs, and profit margins requires complex calculations.
3. **Inventory Discrepancies**: Without a unified system, stock synchronization across platforms becomes difficult.
4. **Data Analysis Gaps**: Most marketplace platforms provide limited analytics, making it hard for sellers to make data-driven decisions.
